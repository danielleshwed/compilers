    "\\par A finite state machine is easiest thought of as a pattern recognizer. The relevance to compilers is that compilers are often built using a finite state machine to encode the current state and actions as well as transitions to other states. The reason why we would want to minimize the states in a finite state machine is to minimize the cost, being the time and space. \n"
